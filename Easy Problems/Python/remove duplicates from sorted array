class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        i = 1

        for j in range (1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != nums[i - 1]:
                nums[i] = nums[j]
                i += 1

        return i

        '''same thing as the java implementation: 
        we start at 1 within the range of 1 through len(nums), then we check to see if at our current pos
        its != prev #. If that's true, then we set nums[i], where i is our holder here (or rememberer) to nums[j]
        which is our current pos, and then we += 1 to i to move it to the next pos. This make sure that holder moves
        alongside the for loop and current in cases where there's no duplicates and if there are duplicates, the 
        condition isn't true and holders stays at its current pos until the condition is no longer true, at which
        point, the holder gets replaced with the current # which is a non-duplicate. 
        
        only thing that is diff w/ this implementation is the function declaration, where self is always needed 
        (like a "this" in java), a nums:List[int] where we have a List of ints called nums, and -> int, which means
        we return an int at the end'''
